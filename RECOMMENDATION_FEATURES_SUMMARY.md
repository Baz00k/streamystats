# New Recommendation Features Summary

## üöÄ **Features Implemented**

### 1. **Comprehensive Watched Item Exclusion**
- **What it does**: Ensures that users never see recommendations for movies they've already watched
- **How it works**:
  - Queries all `PlaybackSession` records for the user to get watched items
  - Filters out ANY movie the user has started watching (regardless of completion percentage)
  - Excludes items from all recommendation algorithms

### 2. **Hide Recommendation Feature**
- **What it does**: Allows users to permanently hide specific recommendations they don't want to see
- **How it works**:
  - Adds a "Hide" button in the large modal dialog for each recommendation
  - Stores hidden recommendations in a new `hidden_recommendations` database table
  - Hidden items are excluded from future recommendations across all algorithms
  - Immediate UI feedback with loading states and toast notifications

### 3. **Removed Items Exclusion**
- **What it does**: Automatically excludes items that have been marked as removed from the server
- **How it works**:
  - Filters out any item where `removed_at` is not null
  - Applied across all recommendation queries and access checks
  - Ensures recommendations only include currently available content

## üõ† **Technical Implementation**

### Backend Changes
1. **New Database Table**: `hidden_recommendations`
   - Tracks user-item-server combinations for hidden recommendations
   - Includes timestamps and proper indexing for performance

2. **Enhanced Session Analysis**:
   - New `get_excluded_item_ids()` function combines watched + hidden items
   - Updated all recommendation algorithms to use comprehensive exclusion
   - Added `hide_recommendation()` function for API endpoint
   - **Added `removed_at` filtering across all item queries**

3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /statistics/recommendations/hide/:item_id` - Hide a recommendation
   - Updated existing endpoints to pass `server_id` for proper filtering

4. **Comprehensive Item Filtering**:
   - All recommendation queries now exclude: watched items + hidden items + removed items
   - Applied to: `build_similarity_query`, `find_similar_items_to_item`, `find_similar_items_for_session`, `find_items_from_similar_sessions`, `find_contributing_movies`
   - Access control functions also respect `removed_at` flag

### Frontend Changes
1. **Enhanced Component**:
   - Added hide button with eye-off icon in recommendation modals
   - State management for loading states during hide operations
   - Real-time UI updates when items are hidden (immediate removal from grid)
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

2. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Fixed null safety issues with `jellyfin_id` properties
   - Proper filtering to exclude items without valid IDs

## üìä **User Experience**

### Before
- Users might see movies they've already watched
- No way to remove unwanted recommendations
- Static recommendation lists
- Removed items could still appear in recommendations

### After
- Clean recommendations with no already-watched content
- User control over recommendations with hide functionality
- Dynamic lists that respond to user actions
- Immediate feedback for all interactions
- **Only active, available content appears in recommendations**

## üîß **Usage**

### For Users
1. **View Recommendations**: Browse the three tabs (Standard, Contextual, Genre Boosted)
2. **Hide Unwanted Items**: Click any movie poster ‚Üí Click "Hide" button in the modal
3. **Instant Feedback**: Item disappears immediately with success toast

### For Developers
1. **Database Migration**: Run the migration to create `hidden_recommendations` table
2. **API Usage**: Use the new hide endpoint to manage user preferences
3. **Frontend Integration**: Component automatically handles state management
4. **Item Management**: Items with `removed_at` set are automatically excluded from all recommendations

## üèÜ **Benefits**

1. **Better User Experience**: No duplicate, hidden, or removed content in recommendations
2. **Personalization**: Users can curate their recommendation feed
3. **Performance**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
4. **Scalability**: Cached results with automatic cache invalidation
5. **Type Safety**: Robust TypeScript implementation with proper null handling
6. **Content Integrity**: Only currently available content is recommended

## üîÑ **Cache Management**

- Recommendations are cached for performance
- Cache is automatically cleared when users hide items
- New recommendations are generated on next request
- Separate cache keys for different recommendation types

## üõ°Ô∏è **Content Filtering**

The recommendation system now applies a comprehensive three-layer filter:

1. **System Level**: Excludes items with `removed_at` timestamp (unavailable content)
2. **User Level**: Excludes items the user has already watched (any completion %)
3. **Preference Level**: Excludes items the user has manually hidden

This ensures users only see relevant, available, and fresh recommendations.
